Make a .gitignore for all venv stuff, besides requirements.txt

Make a .venv for the project and run it (does NOT go to git)
	python3 -m venv .venv
	source .venv/bin/activate

Install what is needed in the venv
	pip install fastapi "uvicorn[standard]"

Lock the necessary things in a requirements.txt file
	pip freeze > requirements.txt


In the project
	main.py is where everything starts

COMMANDS - in top level of project
	-uvicorn main:app --reload
		START the app and reload on changes. main is module, app is instance. in main.py
		

DOCS by default for API
	http://localhost:8000/docs
		so the /docs gives you an interactive documentation on your API
		You can opent the API points and click "try it out" on the top right to do actually do the end points. HOLY FUCK!
			EVEN POST!!


	http://localhost:8000/redoc
		so just /redoc after
		JUST the API documentation. NOT interactive
