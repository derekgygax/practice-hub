INFO
  State is immutable

Add Redux to Project - redux toolkit used now
  bun add @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux

Redux DevTools
  Add this to your browser so you can see redux being used on your browser
  https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en&pli=1

  On Google Chrome - MAKE SURE TO CLEAR CACHE AND REFRESH IF NOT WORKING!!
    In inspector go to Redux
      Choose Inspector in bottom center
      Can see State, or Diff as you manipulate things


Redux Toolkit
  This is what is used NOW
  Not all the weird boilerplate that used to be used

Store in Redux
	Where the state lives
  Responsible for the data flow
  
  Reducer
    Does the actual state changes
    Remember the state is immutable so you did NOT directly manipulate the state

Action
  Dispatch what actually does stuff
  type: what is going to be doen
  payload: data

CSS with material UI

Slice
  Manages the state to the reducer
  All parts of the piece of that redux state

store/habit-slice.ts
  This is where everything that deals with the state is defined
  All the actions and reducers and crap

Setup
  -store folder
    Holds all the redux stuff

    -habit-slice: this is where everything that deals with the state is defined

  -App.tsx
    Wrap the return in the Provider
    This is what lets the application grab the stuff in the store
